I also served as head teacher and liaison between administration and the staff.</p><p>When you teach young children, and regularly train and welcome staff who are new to a school and a country, you have to be humble, flexible, and optimistic. As an adult living and teaching in a foreign country where I don't speak the language, I've often had to rethink my questions in order to get the right answers -- especially when talking to someone who isn't even sure what the problem is.</p><p>I've always been passionate about creating things. As I began programming, that love branched from storytelling towards functionality. My most recent personal project is a website that recommends holiday movies based on desired tropes. My next project focuses on accessibility plugin for neurodiverse web users who find the small, homogeneous text on websites difficult to read. I am a strong believer in technology and automation making our lives easier, and I want to contribute to the solution.</p>";
