            <p><span class="recipeIntro">Making a holiday fashion is almost as easy as drinking one.
                The recipe is easily scalable to serve your whole party, or a party of one!</span><br>
                <strong>Serves 6</strong></p>
                <img src="./recipes/holiday_fashion/katiefashion.jpg" />
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>ice cubes</li>
                <li>bitters or orange bitters</li>
                <li>two jiggers per serving of Scotch, Bourbon, Whiskey, or Rum</li>
                <li>an orange peel, cranberries, or rosemary for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Combine the sugar and water in a small pan. Bring to a low boil, stirring the sugar into the water.
                Once the sugar is fully dissolved (it's quick!), remove from heat and let cool for one hour.
                After the mixture is cool, prepare a <a target="_blank" href="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/219457/1849301.jpg">rocks glass</a> with ice. For each serving, pour 2 jiggers of your choice
                of dark liquor over the ice. Then add 1/3 cup of the sugar mixture, a dash of bitters,
                and your garnish. If you'd like it sweeter, use less liquor and more mix - and the opposite
                if you're looking for something to relieve holiday stress!
            </p>
            <p>Enjoy the Holiday Fashion in front of your favorite holiday movie, preferably something
                in black & white where everyone is chain smoking.

            <ul>
                <p><strong>For the pasta*:</strong></p>
                <li>1 & 1/4 cups all-purpose flour**</li>
                <li>2 eggs, room temperature***</li>

                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>the juice of 1 lemon</li>

                <li>1 cup broccoli, fresh or frozen</li>
                <li>fresh Parmasan cheese for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <aside>*Don't have a pasta roller? Use a good rolling pin.</aside>
            <aside>**You could also use bread flour if you want your pasta to have a little more bite.</aside>
            <aside>***Room temp eggs are a must for a flexible dough! Trust me</aside>
            <p>To make the pasta: <br>
                Mix the flour and 1/2 tsp salt in a bowl. Make a little well in the middle, and crack both eggs into it.
                Drop the EVOO into the eggs, and then use a whisk or fork to work in the flour, starting from the bottom of the egg-oil mixture.
                Once the liquid is absorbed, use your hands or a rubber scraper to work the mixture into a dough. If it
                seems dry, add a little more oil. Knead gently for a few minutes until the dough is uniform. Set the dough
                aside in a bowl to let it rest.
            </p>
            <p>To make the sauce:<br>
                While the dough is resting, melt 2 tbsp butter over low heat in a large, deep pan. Add the oil and the garlic and sautee until
                aromatic. Season with salt and pepper (Grr likes to use red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning as well). Now that
                it's smellin' good, add the wine, shredded chicken, and broccoli. Keep the heat low, stirring occasionally, to let the wine
                thicken the sauce and heat up the meat & veg. (In other words, don't let it boil.) After about five minutes,
                add the lemon juice and the remaining butter. Once the butter melts, turn off the heat and cover the pan to keep it warm.
            </p>
            <p>Cook dem noods:<br>
                Fill a pot with water, add the salt, and set it to boil.<br>
                Dust a large cutting board or clean counter top with flour. Divide the pasta dough into three or four sections. Using your rolling pin, gradually roll the dough into a rectangle-ish shape, flipping the dough to keep it
                coated in flour. (If your dough is too sticky, it will turn into a glob in the pot!) You want the pasta to be
                as thin as you can get - about 1/8 of an inch. When you're ready, roll the pasta into a log (like a <em>Buche du Noel</em>)
                and slice it vertically. Grr usually makes her noodles fettucine-width, but you can make them as wide or as narrow as you prefer.<br>
                After the noodles are sliced, toss them in a little bit of flour to make sure they're coated (you really don't want them
                to stick together.) Repeat with the rest of the pasta dough. When the water boils, use gentle fingertips to drop
                the pasta into the water, keeping them as individual as possible.<br>
                <strong>Fresh pasta cooks really fast!</strong> You'll only need 2-3 minutes. Drain without rinsing and put directly into the 
                prepared sauce and combine.
            </p>
            <p>Serve it up:<br>
                Put that goodness onto plates AND COVER IT IN FRESH PARMESAN CHEESE. You will not regret it. It pairs 
                very nicely with a glass of the white wine you used to in it, if you're into that sort of thing.
