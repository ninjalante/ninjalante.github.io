            <h2 id="badmoms">A Bad Moms Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines</aside>
            <p>A trio of overwhelmed mom friends decide to take Christmas easy this year...until their own needy moms come to town.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: If you're looking to unwind and have a laugh on your own while you're wrapping presents or baking cookies, this movie is for you. Beware: though "mom" is in the title, this movie is not family-friendly.</p>

        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="CAxmas">A California Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Lauren Swickard and Josh Swickard</aside>
            <p>In order to win his mother's approval, a lawyer poses as a farm hand to coerce a struggling farmess into selling her land.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 43</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This one was really bad. Why is the 'feisty,', I-don't-need-to-be-rescued female 'protagonist' (less screen time than the male protagonist and his bro driver) constantly making excuses for the violent friend of her late fiance who keeps pressuring her to go out with him? Also, the male protagonist looks too much like Martin Shkreli</p>

        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="CAxmas2">A California Christmas 2: City Lights</h2>
            <aside>starring Lauren Swickard and Josh Swickard</aside>
            <p>After getting engaged, a young couple's lives are upended when they have to leave their dairy farm and winery in the country to settle unfinished business of all kinds in San Francisco.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 37</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I started this movie and was so bored ten minutes in that I just stopped it and continued baking in total silence, as that was more enjoyable. I put it back on a couple days later, and got *literally* another five minutes in before I guessed what all the plot problems and points were going to be, closed my eyes, and slept through the rest. And guess what? I was 100% right on all counts. There's so, so many slow-motion montages that add nothing - someone doesn't grasp that "visual storytelling" means you should be telling a story instead of just showing visuals - and some of the sound editing and character moments are actually the things you would see in a child's cartoon. Plus, the acting is terrible. You'd think 2020 would have, at least, reinvigorated some of these actors to make them happy to be alive, but maybe they're all just as exhausted as I am. </p>

            <h2 id="carol-scott">A Christmas Carol (1984)</h2>
            <aside>starring George C. Scott, David Warner, and Roger Rees</aside>
            <p>A rich old man learns the meaning of Christmas from four ghosts.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 73</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Tied for fourth in the versions I'm including, as it's pretty boring to watch as an adult. Fun fact: this was a made-for-TV movie, which is why it's not exactly the most dynamic thing ever.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="carol-patrick">A Christmas Carol (1999)</h2>
            <aside>starring Sir Patrick Stewart, Richard E. Grant, Joel Grey, Ian McNiece, and Dominic West</aside>
            <p>A rich old man learns the meaning of Christmas from four ghosts played by classically-trained British actors.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 77</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This cast is insane. I remember reading that this was Sir Patrick's attempt to TV-ize his one-man Christmas Carol show, which Wil Wheaton and other friends have raved about. It's not bad but certainly the least re-watchable; especially the part where he sits down and laughs harder and harder for a full minute, alone in his chambers. I think that would have been much more powerful on stage. But, he's still a total PILF, and the P there stands for Patrick. Joel Grey does a great little gender-fluid Ghost of Christmas Past tho</p>

            <h2 id="xmasPrince">A Christmas Prince</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lamb, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>A journalist breaks into a foreign royal family's home and poses as a new employee so she can get the scoop on the heir's plans to take the throne...or not.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 56</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Barf. The part where they fall into each other's arms in slow-motion...ugh. Netflix hit the jackpot with it though.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasPrince2">A Christmas Prince 2: The Royal Wedding</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lam, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>A queen-to-be feels overwhelmed as royal protocols take over her hopes of a small wedding.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 54</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Good thing she's getting married because I have a feeling her investigative journalism career wasn't going to take off. "Fishy."</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasPrince3">A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lamb, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>With her first child's arrival imminent, the queen has to solve the mystery of the missing artifact that maintains peace between neighboring countries.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 63</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: These are very light entertainment that border on farcical, but at least they tried to add historical wrongs to this one. I know that when Queen Elizabeth had an emergency, they used to send Prince Philip out alone on a horse in the snow. He probably would have preferred that, actually</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasstory">A Christmas Story</h2>
            <aside>starring Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillion, and Darren McGavin</aside>
            <p>A man recounts the Christmas that he asked his parents for an air rifle, beat up the school bully, and discovered that prizes are pieces of junk.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: The TBS marathon is overkill, but it's very, very good when you don't watch it more than once or twice in a row. Three times tops.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmascinderella">A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish</h2>
            <aside>starring Laura Marano and Gregg Sulkin</aside>
            <p>A department store elf works to launch her music career as her step-family gets in the way.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 68</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Not terrible, and certainly entertaining enough</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="garfieldxmas">A Garfield Christmas Special</h2>
            <aside>starring Lorenzo Music, Pat Carroll, Pat Harrington Jr., David L. Lander</aside>
            <p>A gluttonous cat reluctantly accompanies his owner to his family's farm for Christmas, and makes an unexpected connection with his owner's prickly grandmother.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This was genuinely touching and had some surprising moments. Jon's grandmother is grieving the loss of her husband, and Garfield has real character development as he realizes he can do something nice for someone. The typical family stuff is really funny, and the voice cast is insane: in addition to Lorenzo Music as Garfield, Pat Carroll (Ursula from The Little Mermaid) is Grandma, Pat Harrington Jr. (the landlord from One Day At A Time) is Dad, and David L. Lander (Squiggy from Laverne & Shirley) is his brother. Great fun for the whole family, and a shot of nostalgia to boot.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="famreunion">Family Reunion: Christmas Special</h2>
            <aside>starring Tia Mowry-Hardict, Anthony Alabi, and Jackee Harry</aside>
            <p>A close-knit family faces interpersonal conflict as they get ready for Christmas.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 82</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Maybe it's because I watched this while I was super fragile during CovidChristmas, but I was genuinely touched by it.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="haroldandkumar">A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Kal Penn, John Cho, Neil Patrick Harris, and Thomas Lennon</aside>
            <p>Two stoners have to replace a Christmas tree they destroyed, but shenanigans stand in their way.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 74</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Very funny, but NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN. The "hilarious" sexual coercion scene when NPH tries to get a sexual favor from his masseuse was genuinely upsetting, particularly that scenes like that are still being included for lolz.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="nutxmas">A Very Nutty Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Melissa Joan Hart and Barry Watson</aside>
            <p>A workaholic baker learns about the magic of Christmas when a cursed Nutcracker transforms into a flesh-and-blood man the week before Christmas.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 40</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Listen, listen, listen, listen. Listen to me. Just don't watch this movie, k? It doesn't make any sense. Props to MJH's character for the horrific realization that she's trying to bang a toy, and ending it before it...goes too far? Goes nowhere because he's like a Ken doll under there? Each moment of this movie was more unbelievable than the last. It did actually surprise me for how unpredictable its bad decisions were. My (least?) favorite part is that the Nutcracker's constant insane behavior makes everyone else in town think he's NUTS (wordplay intended), but his incredible nut-cracking ability endears him to MJH. I could go on about this movie forever, but I won't. If you ever see me in person, like, at a bar, when I've had half a glass of wine, feel free to ask me about it and I'll give you an earful.</p>

        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="wish4xmas">A Wish for Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Lacey Chabert and Paul Greene</aside>
            <p>A young woman fed up with being walked all over at work is given the chance to change her life when a magical Santa gives her 48 hours to be assertive.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 75</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I found this in 2017 and I've rewatched it every year.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="alienxmas">Alien Xmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Dee Bradley Baker, Keythe Farley, Kaliayh Rhambo</aside>
            <p>An alien learns the true meaning of Christmas when he comes to Earth and is mistaken for a child's toy.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 85</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It was cute and short and perfect for that little kid who needs to give you a break.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="id">Angels in the Snow</h2>
            <aside>starring Kristy Swanson, Chris Potter, Colin Lawrence, Catherine Lough Haggquist</aside>
            <p>A bickering, privileged white family stranded in a snowstorm provides a warm home to a less fortunate black family stranded in the snowstorm.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 50</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I think my summary probably isn't as unbiased as it should be for this one. Really one of the worst I've seen. Can you guess the twist ending?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="bridget">Bridget Jones's Diary</h2>
            <aside>starring Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Gemma Jones, Jim Broadbent</aside>
            <p>Finding herself single on another Christmas, a young woman who specializes in making a fool of herself finds that things start to go her way once she embraces it.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 80</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This is one of my favorite rom coms, and as it begins and ends near Christmas, it was necessary to include - but it's not necessarily Christmassy.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="checkinn">Check Inn to Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Rachel Boston, Wes Brown, Richard Karn, Tim Reid</aside>
            <p>Two former high school sweethearts convince their dads - who are lifelong business rivals - to cooperate and run a soulless corporation out of town.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 79</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Christmas trivia doesn't sound like anything you need to study for, unless, you know, you don't celebrate Christmas. The chemistry between the two leads - and the plot device that they'd known each other for decades - made a huge difference.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmaspalace">Christmas at the Palace</h2>
            <aside>starring Merritt Patterson, Andrew Cooper, Brittany Bristow, and Nicholas Banks</aside>
            <p>Two travelling figure skaters delay their plans to return home for Christmas in order to help the princess of a small European country produce a holiday spectacular on ice.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 53</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: After watching this, I believe now, more than ever, that the element that will almost *certainly* sink any Christmas movie, is the presence of a Christmas prince. Every prince is SO bland that I genuinely struggle to remember what each one looks like from one movie to the next. If a prince -- or a KING -- isn't married yet, there is something SO wrong with him that not even a 19-year-old with abandonment issues could be manipulated into marrying him. RUN.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasstar">Christmas by Starlight</h2>
            <aside>starring Kimberley Sustad and Paul Campbell</aside>
            <p>A young lawyer agrees to help a young real estate developer impress his boss-dad in exchange for him not tearing down her family's cute little diner.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 77</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Am I going soft? I think I liked this one. The male lead gives off STRONG bargain bin Ryan Reynolds vibes, and the female lead aims high to be confused with Lorelei Gilmore. Both things I can get behind. ALSO, his assistant is not only gay, but a happily married gay man. I was extremely disappointed that the main's last name is Park, but she's not Korean.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmaseveryday">Christmas Every Day</h2>
            <aside>starring Erik von Detten and Robert Hays</aside>
            <p>After his sister wishes for Christmas every day, a young teen's Christmas becomes increasingly frustrating.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 57</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I saw this when I was about 12. But only once. I didn't watch it nearly as many times as I watched that one with Mimi Rogers</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasct">Christmas in Connecticut</h2>
            <aside>starring Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet, and S.Z. Sakall</aside>
            <p>A popular lifestyle writer agrees to marry a stuffy Connecticut architect if he'll help her entertain her boss and a war hero for Christmas.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: 100% perfection, and Dennis Morgen and Barbara Stanwyck are both dreamboats</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasinlove">Christmas in Love</h2>
            <aside>starring Brooke D'Orsay and Daniel Lissing</aside>
            <p>A bakery HR rep and a visiting corporate heir teach each other life lessons.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 73</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It's very average for Hallmark. But knowing how long it takes to make a wreath, I could not believe how many she made overnight.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasorder">Christmas Made to Order</h2>

            <p>A struggling event planner helps a too-busy corporate man entertain his visiting family over the holidays.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 71</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Not bad! The guy from Mean Girls sneaks in a Chevy Chase impression, which is a highlight</p>
        </section>
        <section class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasvacay">Christmas Vacation</h2>
            <aside>starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Juliette Lewis, Johnny Galecki, John Randolph, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Randy Quaid, William Hickey, Mae Questel, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Brian Doyle Murray</aside>
            <p>A dedicated family man plans to give his family the perfect Christmas, but gets more family than he bargained for.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: One of the few movies that truly captures how stressful and wonderful Christmas is. Plus -- do you SEE this CAST??? I couldn't leave anyone out - legit stars and character actors spanning a century. Google Mae Questel. You will be impressed. Bingo</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 51</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: There's actually banging in this one, which is rare. But even that is dull as heck.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 78</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It's just fine, which is what you get when Chris Columbus rewrites a John Grisham novel. I do love how horny they are for each other.</p>

            <h2 id="xmaswu">Christmas With You</h2>
            <aside>starring Aimee Garcia and Freddie Prinze, Jr.</aside>
            <p>An aging pop star who needs to stay relevant collaborates with a handsome high school music teacher to write a Christmas hit.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 69</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: There's always some hugely contrived reason why a small-town guy/girl and an enormously huge star meet and end up spending the week before Christmas together, but this one really takes the cake. It took a little bit too long for them to meet, in my book, and the slow-motion song-writing montage made me roll my eyes, because Netflix looooooves a montage. However. I LOOOOOOOOVE that Freddie Prinze, Jr., got to play a Latinx man, with a Latinx family, and there were almost no white characters at all! The one white character undertood what a quinceañera was without any 'splaining, and the jumps between Spanish and English felt natural. Also, directed by a Latinx woman? And at least two Latinx writers credited? Yes, please! </p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I didn't hate it. I have a soft spot for Emily Osment. Apparently she spent four months shadowing at an art gallery to 'prepare' for the role. Overkill? Or being a good actor?</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I really like that Lina recognizes that her life is full and happy, but that she'd be even happier if he were a part of it; and that her caring about helping people so much through her job causes her to neglect herself. This one was...good?</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It's Serendipity Lite, but, let's be real, I love this kind of crap. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is on-the-nose ("But how do you feel about that?"), but it's still entertaining enough to watch. Bonus points for a male romantic lead with red hair.

            <p class="myscore">My score: 69</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Without Dolly, it'd be pure garbage. A lot of problems with the theology - for example, that angels are magical enough to fix problems as complicated as fertility with one little finger twitch, but they choose not to. Also, Regina's dad was a piece of shit. Not just because he was so overprotective that she wasn't socialized properly and ended up getting pregnant as a teen, not just because he ripped that baby off her chest the second after he was born, but also because he was the richest man in town and ARPAB.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 87</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I saw this movie in theaters four times, and I have no regrets. You might think I would be cynical about such beloved movie, but the fact is, it's very good, and it began the era of production companies trusting Jon Favreau. (AND LOOK AT THAT CAST.)</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I expected this to be awful, but honestly, it was pretty decent. It's nice to see Lindsay Lohan again, and in a grown-up role; though there is a little Mean Girls Easter egg when she starts to sing "Jingle Bell Rock".</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 77</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I really liked the normalizing and inclusion of Mexican-American culture, though would it have hurt to make Maya's family Mex-Am too? Loved them showing that there's other Mex-Am families in the town who participate in la posada, and that the bakery is important to everyone. It felt a bit like a sequel to another movie, since Maya had gotten a fresh start two years prior, and it was the man, rather than the woman, looking to change careers for a 'simpler' life. Also love that Maya realized she had exactly what she wanted all along. I think Hallmark movie-writing bots are getting smarter...</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 85</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: For being one of the first mainstream LGBTQ-centered Christmas movies, it features a lot of the usual Christmas movie shenanigans: a grown-up child star (Kristen Stewart), a quirky dysfunctional family, TWO hometown exes (Aubrey Plaza and that guy), deception and mistaken identity, and a bunch of slapstick. I am a *bit* annoyed that no one confronted Sloane about her clearly evil children, and would have loved to see more overt conflict there with Abby. Also Kristen Stewart is totally swoon-worthy and it was great to see her in a role so unlike what she's usually in. Also, she does have some really great jackets throughout. Re: family friendly...there's not a ton of bad language, but there is some mild innuendo (including a fully-dressed man in a ball gag). It says PG-13 but I don't remember that at all. </p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 51</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Listen - most of the Hallmark movies made in the last 4-5 years are at least watchable, even if they're somewhat dumb. FIrst of all? There's a store that only sells Christmas hats. They make the hats in their own factory, but they don't make any of the other cheap junk they sell? HOW HAVE THEY BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS? I winced hearing the rich owner say that the employees are family, but was delighted at the end when he said he was giving the company to the employees. How did this film not get investigated by the FBI for being pinko? The only other standout is that it starts in OCTOBER, and covers two months (kind of.) It's pretty bad though. One of the worst. Maybe the absolute worst.</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: New York at Christmas is magical chaos, and somehow, this dumb little show made me feel that holiday spirit hard. Great action sequences as well, and I won't spoil the other things that I enjoyed in case you haven't seen it.

            <p class="myscore">My score: 52</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I watched this after someone told me it was bad. And it was. The twist is, the actor is Jewish. Also, he's OBSESSED with acting, which, I guess, isn't completely off, but also, is incredibly annoying. He has no depth. Not that any of them have depth. Though the brother-in-law and the dad get a nice little arc, but, oof, I can't even think too hard about this one. It's a perfect/awful example of how stakes and emotions just don't exist in some of these movies. There's all this build-up for very little payoff. 
                BUT, I do like that they brought in some Hanukkah. But why not just make a Hanukkah movie? Please?</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I do love this movie. The music and performances are incredible. BUT, there is a song they do entirely in blackface, and when Marjorie Reynolds puts the SHOE POLISH (actual shoe polish) on her face, she whines because she's ugly now. It's..........not great. Fun fact, though, by the time WHITE CHRISTMAS came out, they replaced the blackface with a jazzy tap dance number to the same tune that doesn't include the lyrics or any blackface. (But they also included a song remembering how great minstrel shows were...like the screenwriter and songwriter were upset they couldn't do blackface anymore...so........this movie might not be for you or your family and I understand.)</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: A rare Christmas series that got TWO seasons. I really enjoyed watching the first season, though there was a lot more banging than I was expecting. The second season lives up to the first and doesn't pull any punches. The colors are warm and the cinematography is film-quality. I am a little annoyed whenever an older character in a movie or show dies to set off the protagonist, but I suppose that happens to nurses a lot. This was also my first foray into non-English (Norwegian) Christmas pieces (other than Santa Claus vs. The Devil) and definitely a success.</p>

I don't understand what his limits are. Is he just, like, a robot god? Also, the "reveal" at the end is a BIG eye-roller. The kids must have never left their playroom if they're THAT surprised.</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This was the first Ryan Reynolds movie I saw, and I found him so insufferable that I skipped his other purile comedies for years. In retrospect, it may be a suble send-up of movies like this where intolerable male protagonists try to woo women who've clearly stated their feelings against it, but it's a bit too cartoonish for me. The IMDB summary makes him out to be an incel, calling Amy Smart's character the "woman whose rejection of him turned him into a ferocious womanizer." Yeah, you can't control other people, but you can control your own actions, dude. Barf</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: In the same vein of DIE HARD, while a Christmas movie, it's not Christmassy -- which is the only reason it's scored less than 90. This was so badly mismarketed when it came out, I was lucky to see it at all. Plus, brought RDJ back right before he blew up as Tony Stark. And Val Kilmer is a potty-mouthed delight.</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway:There were some bits I really liked, and some bits that were mediocre. Why do so many moms have vague cancer? The Mick Jagger dancing scene was unbearable. Also, I want Liv Hewson to be able to play a non-binary character.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 68</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I loved this movie for a long time. About five years ago, I realized that I HATE IT. Simon going to the U.S. to be in a five-way AND SUCCEEDING IMMEDIATELY, Andrew Lincoln keeping a tape of Keira Knightly, like, IN his VCR, and don't get me started on the Monica Lewinsky storyline where she's STILL THE ONE WHO'S BLAMED AND BILLY BOB THORNTON HAS NO COMEUPPANCE. This was definitely written by the same man who wrote NOTTING HILL, one of the worst awkward male fantasies I've ever seen.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 84</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Although the movie refers to Love Actually and Die Hard, it actually has the strongest While You Were Sleeping vibes - in a good way. When I saw the trailer, Josh's catfishing came off as really icky to me, and I wasn't even sure I wanted to see it. However, in-movie, it makes a good point about how you can just as easily catfish someone IRL by pretending to be different in order to please them. I enjoyed it more than I wanted to - particularly their reworked Baby It's Cold Outside. But, I didn't really get their chemistry. When they kissed at the end, it felt kind of forced. They are no Bill Pullman/Sandra Bullock.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 82</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This is a fun movie with some unfortunate CGI animals. Like ELF it has some fish-out-of-water moments, but Noelle is way more world-wise than Buddy, so it's more about not knowing about heat or money, but she has applicable real-lief skills that make her a little more endearing than if she was a carbon copy of someone raised by elves. Some great acting and funny moments, and it's always fun to see Shirley MacClaine go from elf to Arizona chic. Lastly, Shirley MacClaine is the PILF here. Just so you know.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 77</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I'm not sure why I love Steven Weber so much, but he's great. Also, he MUST have learned to fly for real because of WINGS, right? Anyhow, I enjoyed this quite a bit. The romantic lead was genuinely hunky, and there was some good family drama in the mix. The name of the town is ridiculous, of course, but that's much less ridiculous than an entire country whose sole identity is based on Christmas (re: CHRISTMAS AT THE PALACE.)</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Tied for fourth-best adaptation, with an edge for songs, but it's boring otherwise. It's way too long, and it's stuffed with stifled British pauses. However, you can't beat Thank You Very Much, December the 25th, I Like Life, and Father Christmas.</p>

            <p>A rich old man with a dog who lives in a diverse 1840s London learns the meaning of Christmas from four ghosts who perform upbeat musical numbers.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 81</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Full disclosure, I had no intention of watching this -- since A Christmas Carol is my favorite story, I'm not usually up for traditional adaptations, as they disappointment me because they either stay SO true to the book that they're dry as hell (the Patrick Stewart one), or they get a little too goofy (the Jim Carrey one). But, I was awake and sobering up from a all-you-can-drink brunch, so, I put it on. It deliberately changes things from the book, which I think Dickens would be all right with, as this version seems aimed specifically at children who aren't familiar with the story, given Netflix's global reach. Scrooge, like Dickens, was forced to work as a child because his father was in debtors' prison, and Isabel dumps Scrooge after watching him and Marley (who's much older than Scrooge) evict Bob Cratchit's parents from their bakery. The film also caught me off-guard because I realized partway through that it was a remake of the 1970 Albert Finney musical, but with a lot of the dryness cut out, and the best songs kept in. Unlike that version, Scrooge doesn't go to hell to meet Marley post-Christmas Future -- but he is dragged into his grave by chains and then hurled through hell, seeing his past, present, and future blended together as he's forcibly wrapped in the same death cloth you see Marley in. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a wax figurine who can transform into any person, AND, she openly mocks Fezziwig's name (if you're not a hardcore Dickensstan like myself, you should know that his characters always have ridiculous names, which is one of the reasons I'm a hardcore Dickensstan.) And the part I REALLY loved! At the end, when Scrooge traditionally gives Cratchit a raise, instead, he makes Cratchit his full partner - Scrooge & Cratchit. It's appropriately scary - it is a ghost story, after all - but I think still appropriate for most children. A great introduction to this story with a lot of pomp and color for kids who can't sit through the George C. Scott version.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 81</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Another INSANE cast full of legends past and present. Lotsa nipples tho, so not really family-friendly, unless you're like my family. This is the second-best adaptation, and does what many modern retellings don't: it makes me feel things. Even that cheesy, preachy monologue at the end; especially the cheesy, preachy monologue at the end.</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Somewhat disappointed that Eleanor, not Marianne, is the focus of the story, but I guess she's the "fun" one. On the other hand, she's pretty relatable.

I don't really enjoy watching people kiss, but, at least the gay characters are getting the same treatment as straight characters. And, it's not a ronchy movie, making space in the family-friendly realm for amn LGBTQ relationship. Huzzah! Also, Kathy Najimy and BARRY BOSTWICK are amazing. Barry Bostwick! KATHY NAJIMY.

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: According to Hallmark's release schedule, this is the Sister Swap you should watch first -- and IMO, the superior swap. It has a stronger structure and character arc, and I have fonder memories of Annie Banks than Victoria the Cupcake Queen. I know that's not fair, but it is what it is. You don't *need* to watch both, but you should. Bonus points for having a character in a wheelchair who isn't fawned over and lives life 'normally.'</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: One of the most effortlessly diverse Hallmark movies I've seen - a black man dating a white woman is NOT something you see very often. Plus, a gay romance with a kiss, a parent in a wheelchair (played by an actor with prosthetic legs), and Kevin Nealon. Plus, there's real joy in real-life sisters Kimberly and Ashley in every scene they share together.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 81</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Whatever you think this movie is going to be, you're wrong. Though the entire royal family is visible here and there, Charles and the Queen only get a few moments of focus; for a dinner scene, everyone but Diana is blurred as she hallucinates eating her necklace. The help at the palace get some great moments, but the most devastating and emotional scenes are between Diana and her sons. Imagine Di took Harry and Wills to the Overlook for Christmas, and this is the movie you'd get. The ending is a total turnaround and feels out of place until you realize, this is what Diana WANTED her life to be like, but instead, she got a pscyhological thriller. Oh and is it Christmassy? If you have a toxic family situation, sure. CW: bulimia and suicide</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Does that summary sound like the least Christmassy thing ever? Then I'm happy for you. The fact is, Christmas isn't a happy time for everyone, and this film uses it as a centerpiece of loneliness -- so it's extremely Christmassy, but in a negative way. I *LOVE* this movie (it's perfect, obvs) and watched it approximately once a week my sophomore year of college. Billy Wilder, once again, knocks it out of the park. I'm so glad that, as far as I've read, Jack Lemmon was one of the nicest people in Hollywood. CW: attempted suicide.</p>

            <p>Two bickering siblings left alone on Christmas Eve discover that Santa Claus is real, and have to work with him to recover his sleigh and his reindeer before time runs out. Also, Santa is hot.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 71</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This movie should have higher ratings - it's got Real Santa and a grown-up child actor who also happens to be an aging well-known actor playing him. But it was a bit too childish for me. I really could have done without the sexy Santa prison song routine. We get that Santa is sexy - it's Kurt Russell. I rolled my eyes a lot. Your children will probably enjoy it, or at least realize something about their sexuality after they see their first sexy Santa.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 75</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Kurt Russell makes a great Santa, but I could do without a 10-minute ooh-and-ahh tour of the North Pole. And the song and dance number. And the protagonist borderline flirting with her dead 13-year-old father. And the weirdly long and slow rendition of O Christmas Tree at the end. Lots of telling AND showing, re: Mrs. Claus's potion capabilities. The first twenty minutes without Santa is a SNOOZE. I was pleased to see Julian Dennison get some more screen time, though.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 70</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: There have been a serious uptick in female writers and directors at Hallmark the past two years! Excellent to see. As far as the story goes, I've noticed that the B plots often have more depth to them than the main romance (here, the grandmother's journey to embrace life again after her husband's death, the child being raised by his grandmother, the senior center being an important and underfunded part of the community), but making them the main plot would be too much conflict for one of these all-smiles-stories. Still - not bad.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 70</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: The child isn't annoying, which is a huge accomplishment. So glad Jonathan Bennett can be gay onscreen. The problems are all solved pretty quickly and no one gets upset very much or for very long, so despite upsetting all kinds of people for featuring an openly gay married couple, it's still standard sugar cookie Christmas fare.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 67</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This movie was so disappointing. What a cast. But the trailer shows the only decent parts. The rest of it drags. The logic of the story isn't logical; who invites their sister to someone else's house for frigging Christmas? And who would actually accept that invitation? Feels like the producers got their grubby little hands into the script too much and fucked it all up. For example, Dermot Mulroney is going to MARRY Sarah Jessica Parker, but when he sees Claire Danes for the first time, he immediately falls for her. Has he never seen a picture of his girlfriend's sister? You know what, this movie sucks. Also you didn't have to kill off the mom to make it emotional, that was a dirty trick to make us feel something after this movie made us feel NOTHING</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Jack Black is the best part and he's way too subdued and underused.

            <p>A successful author returns to his childhood home to clean out the hoarding mess left by his estranged mother, and is approached by a young woman looking for her birth mother, who was his nanny when tragedy struck their family.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 81</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Right, so, this logline sounds like way too much, right? Because it's filled with actual childhood trauma that sticks with the characters until adulthood? Does that have any place in a Christmas movie? As it turns out - yes, it does. I have to wonder if Netflix pushed the original script into the Christmas movie mold so they could figure out what to do with it, because it's genuinely good. (**edit: Actually, it's based on a book, so I guess not.) Going through my list of Christmas movie tropes, this one doesn't really hit any of them, except for being an adaptation, and having an aging well-known actor in it (James Remar.) Slight spoiler, but not really: the ending is a bit of a cop-out, and feels more like what Jake would have written as the ending if he were writing the story himself, or, something shoehorned in by Netflix because it's Christmas. Other than that, recommend! **I have rated this PG but still family-friendly because it blurrily depicts the death of a child.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 49</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Vanessa Hudgeons was super busy last year. Good on her for producing as well. But...it's awful. Don't expect a heart-pounding heist. It's fine for people with underlying heart conditions to watch this film. The tango/laser tango part was the best-edited and best-directed, but even that was extremely campy. If you're watching this to complete the trilogy, though, what else should you expect?</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: #</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This came out in 2020, but it looks like it came out way longer ago than that. Also, the director insists on including "Spanky" as part of his credited name. There's some eyebrow-raising allusions to Otto possibly being a pedophile, which probably had to be included so children around the world wouldn't suddenly befriend the Nazi pedo next door in the hopes of their Christmas wishes coming true. I have to admit, I was really hoping he would be the real Santa Claus. Also, bullies in movies stress me out. Bigtime. Dislike.</p>

            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It's realllly hard for me to watch serious or bumbling police procedurals because they're all reflective of real life. If they hadn't been a tepid romance then it would have been a lot less cringey. Joey Pants carries the whole film. He doesn't pull any punches, even in this silliness.</p>

            <p class="myscore">My score: 89</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This one comes with a few caveats: first off, not family-friendly at all. Lotsa boobies, at least one use of the N-word, and all the swears. Secondly, John Landis, the director, was a bad person whose negligence on-set lead to the death of three actors, two of whom were children. Thirdly, it's the 80s, so, just know it was a different time. All that being said, this movie is fantastic. It's SO funny, and the sword which it wields to skewer the rich and how little they value anything other than money - including those making them money - is sharp as hell. It gets extra Christmassy points for the Eat the Rich Vibe which Dickens himself would approve. Bonus: watch out for a very young, very skinny, not-nearly-as-scary-as-usual Giancarlo Esposito in the holding cell scene.</p>
