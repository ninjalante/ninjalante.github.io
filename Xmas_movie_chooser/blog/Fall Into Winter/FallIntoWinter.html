Wink</span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I&rsquo;ve watched a LOT of holiday movies. I notice patterns. I record data. I track trends with a database and statistics and graphs and reports. You know that. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blog theories, though, usually come after years of study. Dozens of viewings. Thoughts when trying to fall to sleep at night. Insight into movies I&rsquo;ve watched through decades. So it may be a surprise to you - it was certainly a surprise to me - that I have a theory about </span><span class="c1">Fall Into Winter</span><span class="c3">, a winter-themed rom com (no holiday here - just a winter festival that&rsquo;s about a month too late for a solstice) that I&rsquo;ve only seen </span><span class="c16 c3">once</span><span class="c3">.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But </span><span class="c1">have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I only seen it once? Aren&rsquo;t all the holiday TV/streaming releases the same movie? So haven&rsquo;t I seen it about 60* times?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">One of the most common elements of the MFTV (made-for-TV) movie, whatever the holiday, is a Job Problem. Often, there&rsquo;s a conniving Corporate Lemming (sometimes a Fish Out of Water), a demanding Overbearing Boss, or a Struggling Small Business. Sometimes, there&rsquo;s all four: the Lemming (any gender), as protagonist, antagonist, or love interest, is sent to a small town/remote area to do the will of the Overbearing Boss (any gender), who wants to swoop in and level the beautiful family-owned inn/bakery/farm/community center/drive-in movie theater/Struggling Small Business and replace it with a luxury resort. Sometimes, the Corporate Lemming is a representative of a company that has already swupt in (swept? swooped? I&rsquo;m sticking with swupt) and ruined everyone&rsquo;s livelihoods. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hunky love interest who&rsquo;s inexplicably single and/or the feisty protagonist who&rsquo;s been burned by love aren&rsquo;t about to give up. In some, they are probably a boss themselves; owning a small but extremely charming catering company/seasonal decorating service/vineyard/restaurant/Christmas hat store**/apiary***/homemade nut-based flour bakery****. But they are </span><span class="c1">never</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;an </span><span class="c1">Overbearing</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Boss; they&rsquo;re a Good Boss. They are accommodating, understanding, and forgiving. Their employees are sometimes flustered or apologetic if they&rsquo;re late/need to take a phone call/sick/need to pick up a child/take care of a disabled family member. They often give away &ldquo;product&rdquo; or undercharge if someone sympathetic is buying. We see our Good Boss handle these situations with patience and grace, so we know they&rsquo;re Good. If there&rsquo;s a Lemming nearby, there&rsquo;s usually a lot of questions about such Goodness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see both of these in </span><span class="c1">Fall Into Winter.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;James Tupper (the Corporate Lemming/love interest/City Fish Out of Water/Overbearing Boss), the new co-owner of Lori Loughlin&rsquo;s confectionery, when she (a) lets an employee leave to pick up a sick child at school and (b) sells three boxes of chocolate to a little boy for well below market price. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter the movie, whether it&rsquo;s said overtly or not, what separates a Good Boss from any other kind is that they don&rsquo;t care about money. Whether their business is successful (</span><span class="c1">Fall Into Winter</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c1">A Kindhearted Christmas</span><span class="c3">) or not (</span><span class="c1">Catering Christmas</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c1">B&amp;B Merry</span><span class="c3">), they treat their employees, customers, and community with dignity and respect. They </span><span class="c16 c3">need</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;money to keep their business afloat, but that&rsquo;s not what matters most to them.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;People always come before profits, and that&rsquo;s because in this town, this isn&rsquo;t just a business; it&rsquo;s part of the community, and a community takes care of its own.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">When </span><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;debuted in 1946, not only was it a flop, but also it drew the attention of the FBI for </span><span class="c1">subversive Communist undertones</span><span class="c3">. The FBI did not like that Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the petty, sneering slumlord who often went toe-to-toe with the Baileys over their housing projects, was the bad guy, and that George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), the stuttering, head-in-the-clouds, always-broke, has-way-too-many-kids head of Bailey Bros. Building &amp; Loan, a rinky-dink family business that is itself always on the brink of bankruptcy because it gives non-predatory loans to pretty much anyone who applies for one. Most of these loans were used to build homes, and a lot of them were given to immigrants (notably, Mr. Martini, who speaks with a thick Italian accent.) These loans were considered too risky by the bank - and too unprofitable by Mr. Potter, who wanted to keep his tenements full.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, this idea was extremely un-American. Which, on the surface, seems insane &ndash; it&rsquo;s the American dream to build and own your home, especially for immigrants. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you look beneath the surface, and you think about how much people love to quote Adam Smith, none of the decisions George Bailey makes are self-serving. He gives up his dreams of brushing this dusty old town off his feet, going to college, and traveling the world to save the Building &amp; Loan so that Potter won&rsquo;t be able to buy it. He saves his brother&rsquo;s life and loses hearing in one ear. When his Uncle Billy misplaces eight thousand dollars and Mr. Potter threatens to have George arrested for fraud, George doesn&rsquo;t throw him under the bus; he&rsquo;d rather commit suicide so his family can get his life insurance. </span><span class="c1">He leaves a naked Mary (Donna Reed) when his father has a stroke.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Which of these is a bigger sacrifice, I&rsquo;ll leave up to you. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">George doesn&rsquo;t escape this situation easily. He leaves home angry and desperate, which worries his wife. Mary is no wallflower; she leaps into organization mode. As he stands on a bridge overlooking the river, contemplating death, his family and everyone he&rsquo;s ever helped is praying for and looking for him. After his brush with the afterlife and a world without him, he returns home expecting to be arrested; but Mary&rsquo;s appeal to the community has paid off, and all those common folks he&rsquo;s helped have stepped up and collected a basket of cash. An old school chum who&rsquo;s struck it rich offers to wire him ten grand. Mr. Potter doesn&rsquo;t learn anything, and he doesn&rsquo;t change.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In the last 75 years, the film has endeared itself to the public by - wait for it - being played on television. With new audience accessibility, and a lot of checked boxes (Christmas magic, family is #1, family-friendly, romance, well-known actors, precocious children), it went from blacklisted failure to Oscar-nominated classic.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Which brings us back to MFTV movies, the Corporate Lemming, and the David vs. Goliath story we see so often. Do we need to call Senator Rick Scott? Is Lori Loughlin, who was dropped by Hallmark for her role in Operation Varsity Blues and served a ludicrously short federal prison sentence right before making this movie, indoctrinating our kids? Will Candace Cameron Bure, who won&rsquo;t say she supports marriage equality but will say she has gay friends, endorse a universal basic income in 2024? Does Great American Family, a channel founded by a producer who thought Hallmark was straying too far from &ldquo;traditional marriage,&rdquo; want us to be Great American Comrades? Did Chad Michael Murray, who cheated on his wife/co-star shortly after marrying her and got caught because he bragged about it in a text, leave Hallmark because they bring up his infidelity as much as I do in casual conversation?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In short, no.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In long, the idea of having or being a Good Boss is anti-socialist. But we are so used to enduring medieval work conditions where we ask for bathroom breaks, are forbidden from sitting down or eating, and have remote bosses monitoring our mouse movement, that we can&rsquo;t imagine a world without a Boss. It&rsquo;s not socialism; it&rsquo;s old-school, small-town capitalism versus modern, corporate capitalism.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I call it A Good Boss with a Cinnamon Bun.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Despite what &ldquo;not wholesome enough for me&rdquo; producer Bill Abbott thinks, Great American Family and Hallmark movies still peddle the same Great American Values. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Work is really important. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Family is most important, especially the dead ones you don&rsquo;t want to disappoint posthumously. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If you have a stressful job, a toxic work culture, and/or an Overbearing Boss, you should get a different job that more closely aligns with your true passion and God-given gifts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Even an Overbearing Boss can have a change of heart at Christmas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. A Good Boss is kind and understanding, and neither they nor their employees ever talk about living wages, insurance, or paid vacation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If you are struggling financially for any reason, you better pray you&rsquo;re in a Christmas movie.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t worry, Mr. Abbott, no one&rsquo;s trying to paint your holiday movies - sorry, Christmas movies - red. We are trying to figure out what Christ would think of your decision to commercialize and double-down on MFTV movies by creating the Countdown to Christmas campaign for Hallmark, though. Do you think he&rsquo;d flip over the conference room table? I&rsquo;m sure that wasn&rsquo;t a corporate decision made to explode your career and get you an obscene raise. You&rsquo;re just a small-town Long Island guy who&rsquo;s worked as a television executive since the 1980s. You probably marched with SAG-AFTRA and WGA this summer. You&rsquo;re a Good Boss, right?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">*I checked.
