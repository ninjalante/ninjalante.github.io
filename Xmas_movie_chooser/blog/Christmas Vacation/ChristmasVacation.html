Wink</span></p><p class="c12"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to give his family the perfect Christmas. Not just a perfect Christmas, but a &ldquo;fun, old-fashioned, family Christmas.&rdquo; He invites all four bickering grandparents (Diane Ladd, John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, and Doris Roberts) to stay with them for a full week before Christmas. He digs an enormous tree out of the ground with his bare hands. He invites his unpleasant great-uncle (William Hickey) and not-totally-there great-aunt (Mae Questel, </span><span class="c1 c9">the original voice of Betty Boop, BTW)</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;to spend Christmas Eve with them. When his wife&rsquo;s lovely cousin (Miriam Flynn) coasts into town with her two kids, dog, and enthusiastic but dim-witted husband (Randy Quaid) by her side as a &ldquo;surprise,&rdquo; he welcomes them in even as his wife bemoans that they have &ldquo;plenty of room, plenty of towels, plenty of everything.&rdquo; He does this all for his kids (Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki (later can we talk about how insanely insane this cast is???)), to give them a big family Christmas, like the ones he&rsquo;s so nostalgic about when he watches them on the silent 8mm reels he has in his attic.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, you may guess that Clark&rsquo;s holiday isn&rsquo;t quite so ideal. If you have seen it, you know that it&rsquo;s full of [renowned a**hole] Chevy Chase&rsquo;s remarkable physical comedy and timing. Everything, really, EVERYTHING, goes wrong. But as he gazes at the sky on Christmas Eve, listening to his family sing Christmas carols badly in the house behind him, he smiles and sighs, &ldquo;I did it.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Clark &ldquo;the last true family man&rdquo; Griswold is relentlessly ridiculed by his ultimate-80s-yuppie neighbors (Julia Louis-Dreyfus &amp; Nicholas Guest) and ignored by his boss (Brian Doyle Murray). Both the DINK neighbors and the apathetic boss are presented as Clark&rsquo;s foils and nemeses; he would never skip getting a Christmas tree or forget a coworker&rsquo;s name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark has no problem trading insults with his snotty neighbors (everyone in my biological and extended family is a </span><span class="c1 c9">little</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;too comfortable yelling &ldquo;bend over and I&rsquo;ll show ya&rdquo;). But his boss; herein lies Clark&rsquo;s real dilemma. Clark&rsquo;s &ldquo;d*ckless, heartless, hopeless&rdquo; boss is the one who holds Clark&rsquo;s future in his hands; because, unbeknownst to his wife (Beverly D&rsquo;Angelo) or anyone else in his family, Clark has already put down the deposit for the ultimate Christmas present: an in-ground pool. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, I don&rsquo;t know where you grew up, or when. But when I was growing up, where I was growing up, having an in-ground pool meant that God liked you. Where better to spend every summer day than at home, with your kids, bobbing around a pool and eating ice cream and barbecue? Maybe open up your backyard gate and have a block party? Plenty of room, plenty of towels, plenty of everything.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there isn&rsquo;t plenty of anything in Clark&rsquo;s world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark has made a grave mistake: in order to install the pool in time for summer, he&rsquo;s written a check that will bounce unless he gets his Christmas bonus&hellip;soon. As everyone around him shows him minimum amounts of respect, eats his food, and falls asleep in front of the television, Clark waits and worries: without the bonus, there will be no money, no pool, no perfect Christmas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark&rsquo;s neighbors live in a spotless, monochrome house with a slick stereo and wall-to-wall white carpets. They jog in matching outfits and </span><span class="c1 c9">drink bottled water</span><span class="c1">. They&rsquo;re shallow, ruthless, and cruel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark&rsquo;s boss sits at the end of a desk longer than my apartment and lives in a palatial mansion with only his wife, who seems to wear furs exclusively. (Man, remember when it was cool to have a fur coat? The 80s really were the worst.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desiring the perfect Christmas and betting all his financial security on delivering the best gift ever, Clark is just as superficial as his neighbors and as elite as his boss. He wants people to see him differently; not as a man who provides a safe and nurturing home for his family, not as a husband who respects his wife, not as a father whose children genuinely love him; but as a success. Like his gross neighbors. Like his unfeeling boss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="c1 c9">Vacation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;movies started in 1983, with the Griswolds&rsquo; infamous trip to Wally World. It was marked by death, skinny dipping, and a hostage situation, written by John Hughes, and directed by Harold Ramis. Next, the Griswolds went to </span><span class="c1 c9">Europe</span><span class="c1">. (No one really talks about this one, but it was written and directed by the woman who brought us the </span><span class="c1 c9">Look Who&rsquo;s Talking</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;series and </span><span class="c1 c9">Clueless</span><span class="c1">.) After that, we get </span><span class="c1 c9">Christmas</span><span class="c1">, written again by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, the man who replaced Chris Columbus after Chevy Chase became impossible to work with.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chechik is still working (a lot of TV - good for him) but the only other movie I&rsquo;ve seen that he&rsquo;s made is </span><span class="c1 c9">Benny and Joon</span><span class="c1">. By the time the Griswolds go to Vegas in 1997, the script has two credited writers, neither of them Hughes, and a director who&rsquo;s got </span><span class="c1 c9">four</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;credits total.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1989, Clark Griswold is no longer just a frustrated dad hoping to have a nice vacation; he is a man obsessed with status, achievement, and labels. He&rsquo;s grinding. He&rsquo;s stapling lights to the house. He&rsquo;s falling off the roof. He&rsquo;s putting experimental varnish on his sled to be the fastest person on a hill. He&rsquo;s a man driven to insanity by his expectations of a patriarchal, misogynist, capitalist world&rsquo;s expectations of him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the hallmark of all of these movies: at some point, polite, well-employed Clark Griswold loses his mind. How couldn&rsquo;t he? No matter how many times he replaces his kids with better-looking, more famous actors, no one seems to care anymore. He has to pull out a chainsaw to get anyone to take him seriously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c9">Christmas Vacation</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t a comedy; it&rsquo;s a warning. </span><span class="c1 c9">Don&rsquo;t worry so much about success. Success makes you miserable. Expectations are poison. Anything that can be consumed by a consumer can be consumed by fire.</span><span class="c3 c1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be a Griswold this Christmas. Be a Cousin Eddie: coasting into town on fumes, holding out for a management position, and having the boldness to kidnap a millionaire and put him on trial for his crimes. With a big ribbon on his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3 c10">National Lampoon&rsquo;s Christmas Vacation (1989)</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3 c10">My score: 100/100</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3 c1">directed by Jeremiah S.
