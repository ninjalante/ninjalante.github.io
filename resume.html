Teaching young children a second language brought forward new strengths and skills, and taught me what I\'m really capable of.</p><p>But teaching ESL full-time to young children is a lot, and I burned out mid-2019, and left my job at the end of the Korean school year in February 2020 to pursue a career in programming and digital transformation.</p><p>I spend a lot of my free time being creative, whether that\'s on a page, on the stage, or with a muffin tin. If you ask me about my D&D character or Animal Crossing island, I\'ll talk as long as you want.
