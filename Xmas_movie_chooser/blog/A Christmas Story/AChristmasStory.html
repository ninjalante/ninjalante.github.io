Wink</span></p><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Most Christmas movies with child protagonists are garbage. Part of this is because lots of screenwriters don&rsquo;t know how to write children. They&rsquo;re either written too sweet, too selfish, or too stupid. Even as fringe characters, a badly-written niece, nephew, or parentless child can ruin a rom com. Bob Cratchit says that Tiny Tim has wisdom beyond his years &ndash; but think of how annoying that would be if he weren&rsquo;t terminally ill, or if he had more than three or four lines. Barf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why is </span><span class="c4 c5">A Christmas Story</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;endearing, with SIX children sharing the bulk of the story? Part of that is because our narrator is an adult. The story is framed entirely through his memory, with his commentary - both nostalgic and wise - shaping our experience. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny thing about memory; it&rsquo;s notoriously unreliable. Sometimes our memories are unreliable because we didn&rsquo;t mark a moment as significant or interesting. At other times, though, especially when we&rsquo;re children, our brains learn that certain memories are so disruptive to other processes - so traumatic - that they need to be forgotten.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Does 40-year-old Kevin McCallister remember the time when he was 7 and he was left #HomeAlone by his entire extended family and then nearly murdered by thieves? Probably &ndash; but he probably doesn&rsquo;t remember Joe Pesci threatening to bite off his fingers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kevin isn&rsquo;t alone. He has a vast congress of siblings, cousins, and fringe relatives who have their own memories of that Christmas. What do they remember? What was significant to them? Does Buzz remember eating an entire cheese pizza and barfing it up? Does Fuller remember wetting the bed every night? Does his sister Linnie remember calling him &ldquo;les incompetents&rdquo;? Does his mom remember screaming &ldquo;KEVIN!&rdquo; in first class?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does his mom remember freaking out? Definitely. She probably also remembers how weirdly calm her husband and father of her children was the entire time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Ralphie remember shooting his eye out?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">Definitely</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When [whatever]-aged adult Ralph[ie] (his wife must call him Ralph, right?) recalls the Christmas he stood up to a bully, got kicked in the face by Santa, helped his father change a tire for the first time, and learned about the true nature of the relationship between Ovaltine and &ldquo;Little Orphan Annie,&rdquo; he is an eager and garrulous detailer of his emotions and the emotions and expressions of others. He also frequently hints that something big is about to happen - when his mother destroys the lamp, for example - and remembers to introduce the Bumpuses&rsquo; dogs well before they eat the turkey in Act 3. (Everyone knows that a Bumpus dog seen in Act 1 </span><span class="c4 c5">must</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;eat a turkey in Act 3.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he lifts the BB gun to his eye, however, he&rsquo;s suspiciously quiet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he&rsquo;s forgotten. It wasn&rsquo;t the big thing that happened that year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Christmas, for Ralphie, was the one where he discovered that his parents are capable of understanding, forgiveness, and kindness. Despite the soap incident, his mother doesn&rsquo;t tell his father that he got in a fight; and his father, despite his mother&rsquo;s objections, buys him a BB gun for Christmas. He realized that his parents were people too. This Christmas, he started to grow up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how, you ask, would he forget about &ldquo;shooting his eye out&rdquo;? Well, let&rsquo;s see. Adult Ralphie contains a tremendous amount of nostalgia, romance, and adventure not just about the BB gun, but about this Christmas itself. As he&rsquo;s only 9 or 10 years old, who would be the one to remind him of this incident? Either his friends or his parents. But none of them are there, and when he begins to panic about his broken glasses, he quickly comes up with a story: an icicle fell off the garage and broke his glasses. His mother immediately takes it seriously and believes him, even telling him that icicles are known to kill people. That becomes the official story, and so that is what&rsquo;s told, if the story is told at all, in this busy, memory-filled Christmas of old.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you still don&rsquo;t believe me, but, well, I&rsquo;m ready for that. Adult Ralphie narrates his childhood with the carefully selected words of someone who sat down and wrote it first. Even in times of great emotion for Young Ralphie, Adult Ralphie is stalwart and reflective. But when the BB hits his glasses and knocks him down, Adult Ralphie shouts, &ldquo;Oh my God, I&rsquo;d shot my eye out!!!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s genuinely shocked. He doesn&rsquo;t even have a follow-up; instead, there are echoes of every single person who&rsquo;s warned him that he was going to shoot his eye out. Shame pushes the memory out to the back of his mind; his mother&rsquo;s constant warnings for the rest of his life to be careful of falling icicles bury it there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone mention how Ralphie&rsquo;s glasses really broke in </span><span class="c4 c5">A Christmas Story Christmas</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(2022)?
