            <h2 id="badmoms">A Bad Moms Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines</aside>
            <p>A trio of overwhelmed mom friends decide to take Christmas easy this year...until their own needy moms come to town.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: If you're looking to unwind and have a laugh on your own while you're wrapping presents or baking cookies, this movie is for you. Beware: though "mom" is in the title, this movie is not family-friendly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="CAxmas">A California Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Lauren Swickard and Josh Swickard</aside>
            <p>In order to win his mother's approval, a lawyer poses as a farm hand in order to coerce a struggling farmess into selling her land.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 43</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This one was really bad. Why is the 'feisty,', I-don't-need-to-be-rescued female 'protagonist' (less screen time than the male protagonist and his bro driver) constantly making excuses for the violent friend of her late fiance who keeps pressuring her to go out with him? Also, the male protagonist looks too much like Martin Shkreli</p>

        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="carol-scott">A Christmas Carol</h2>
            <aside>starring George C. Scott, David Warner, and Roger Rees</aside>
            <p>A rich old man learns the meaning of Christmas from four ghosts.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 73</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Tied for fourth in the versions I'm including, as it's pretty boring to watch as an adult. Fun fact: this was a made-for-TV movie, which is why it's not exactly the most dynamic thing ever.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasPrince">A Christmas Prince</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lamb, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>A journalist breaks into a foreign royal family's home and poses as a new employee so she can get the scoop on the heir's plans to take the throne...or not.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 56</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Barf. The part where they fall into each other's arms in slow-motion...ugh. Netflix hit the jackpot with it though.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasPrince2">A Christmas Prince 2: The Royal Wedding</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lam, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>A queen-to-be feels overwhelmed as royal protocols take over her hopes of a small wedding.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 54</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Good thing she's getting married because I have a feeling her investigative journalism career wasn't going to take off. "Fishy."</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasPrince3">A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby</h2>
            <aside>starring Rose McIver, Ben Lamb, and Alice Krige</aside>
            <p>With her first child's arrival imminent, the queen has to solve the mystery of the missing artifact that maintains peace between neighboring countries.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 63</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: These are very light entertainment that border on farcical, but at least they tried to add historical wrongs to this one. I know that when Queen Elizabeth had an emergency, they used to send Prince Philip out alone on a horse in the snow. He probably would have preferred that, actually</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmasstory">A Christmas Story</h2>
            <aside>starring Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillion, and Darren McGavin</aside>
            <p>A man recounts the Christmas that he asked his parents for an air rifle, beat up the school bully, and discovered that prizes are pieces of junk.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 100</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: The TBS marathon is overkill, but it's very, very good when you don't watch it more than once or twice in a row. Three times tops.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="xmascinderella">A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish</h2>
            <aside>starring Laura Marano and Gregg Sulkin</aside>
            <p>A department store elf works to launch her music career as her step-family gets in the way.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 68</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Not terrible, and certainly entertaining enough</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="famreunion">Family Reunion: Christmas Special</h2>
            <aside>starring Tia Mowry-Hardict, Anthony Alabi, and Jackee Harry</aside>
            <p>A close-knit family faces interpersonal conflict as they get ready for Christmas.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 82</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Maybe it's because I watched this while I was super fragile during CovidChristmas, but I was genuinely touched by it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="haroldandkumar">A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Kal Penn, John Cho, Neil Patrick Harris, and Thomas Lennon</aside>
            <p>Two stoners have to replace a Christmas tree they destroyed, but shenanigans stand in their way.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 74</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Very funny, but NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN. The "hilarious" sexual coercion scene when NPH tries to get a sexual favor from his masseuse was genuinely upsetting, particularly that scenes like that are still being included for lolz.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="wish4xmas">A Wish for Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Lacey Chabert and Paul Greene</aside>
            <p>A young woman fed up with being walked all over at work is given the chance to change her life when a magical Santa gives her 48 hours to be assertive.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 75</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I found this in 2017 and I've rewatched it every year.</p>
        </div>
       <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="alienxmas">Alien Xmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Dee Bradley Baker, Keythe Farley, Kaliayh Rhambo</aside>
            <p>An alien learns the true meaning of Christmas when he comes to Earth and is mistaken for a child's toy.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 85</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: It was cute and short and perfect for that little kid who needs to give you a break.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="id">Angels in the Snow</h2>
            <aside>starring Kristy Swanson, Chris Potter, Colin Lawrence, Catherine Lough Haggquist</aside>
            <p>A bickering, privileged white family stranded in a snowstorm provides a warm home to a less fortunate black family stranded in the snowstorm.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 50</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: I think my summary probably isn't as unbiased as it should be for this one. Really one of the worst I've seen. Can you guess the twist ending?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="bridget">Bridget Jones's Diary</h2>
            <aside>starring Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Gemma Jones, Jim Broadbent</aside>
            <p>Finding herself single on another Christmas, a young woman who specializes in making a fool of herself finds that things start to go her way once she embraces it.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 80</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: This is one of my favorite rom coms, and as it begins and ends near Christmas, it was necessary to include - but it's not necessarily Christmassy.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="movieCard">
            <h2 id="checkinn">Check Inn to Christmas</h2>
            <aside>starring Rachel Boston, Wes Brown, Richard Karn, Tim Reid</aside>
            <p>Two former high school sweethearts convince their dads - who are lifelong business rivals - to cooperate and run a soulless corporation out of town.</p>
            <p class="myscore">My score: 79</p>
            <p class="gretastake">My takeaway: Christmas trivia doesn't sound like anything you need to study for, unless, you know, you don't celebrate Christmas. The chemistry between the two leads - and the plot device that they'd known each other for decades - made a huge difference.</p>
