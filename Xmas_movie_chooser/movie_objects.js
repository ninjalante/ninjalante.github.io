I started this movie and was so bored ten minutes in that I just stopped it and continued baking in total silence, as that was more enjoyable. I put it back on a couple days later, and got *literally* another five minutes in before I guessed what all the plot problems and points were going to be, closed my eyes, and slept through the rest. And guess what? I was 100% right on all counts. There's so, so many slow-motion montages that add nothing - someone doesn't grasp that 'visual storytelling' means you should be telling a story instead of just showing visuals - and some of the sound editing and character moments are actually the things you would see in a child's cartoon. Plus, the acting is terrible. You'd think 2020 would have, at least, reinvigorated some of these actors to make them happy to be alive, but maybe they're all just as exhausted as I am. *Mostly family-friendly except for one sad attempt at a romantic love scene that I actually fast-forwarded through.",

I am a *bit* annoyed that no one confronted Sloane about her clearly evil children, and would have loved to see more overt conflict there with Abby. Also Kristen Stewart is totally swoon-worthy and it was great to see her in a role so unlike what she's usually in. Also, she does have some really great jackets throughout. Re: family friendly...there's not a ton of bad language, but there is some mild innuendo (including a fully-dressed man in a ball gag). It says PG-13 but I don't remember that at all. ",

I have to admit, I was really hoping he would be the real Santa Claus. Also, bullies in movies stress me out. Bigtime. Dislike.",
