            <p>Grr didn't work a traditional job this year - giving her a flexible schedule
            to plan, shop for, and cook more elaborate meals. Living in Seoul, it's easy to get around
            on public transpo - but given all that stuff we don't need to address, you can 
            understand that she wasn't very eager to get on the subway or bus. 
            Instead, she learned to longboard, and took her wheels 2km to the supermarket and back with a
             backpack full of pork shoulder and olive oil, or made the 8km trek to Costco to load up on 
             cheese and wine.
